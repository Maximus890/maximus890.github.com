<h1>Helping the Community</h1>
<p>I first met Essie Reed, affectionately called Big Mama, in 2011. Despite her own struggles
in life, she gives back to the South Florida community nonstop. Wherever there are Floridians 
in need-she is there to help. She is truly a motivational role model for good in our community.</p>

<p>Max also collected books for the <a href="justice.html">Broward County Juvenile Detention Center</a>. He hopes
that their small little closet of a library, will grow bigger to house all of the books
he brings. </p>
